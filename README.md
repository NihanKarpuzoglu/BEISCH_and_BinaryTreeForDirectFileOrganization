# BEISCH_and_BinaryTreeForDirectFileOrganization
For at most 900 random keys, BEISCH and Binary Tree algorithms are implemented with C#.NET. Packing factor is ~ %90. For each algorithm, the program shows the corresponding table on screen. Moreover, for each key value, the program computes the number of probes required in each algorithm. The program compares the performance of algorithms for a random number of keys value given by the user and allows users to search for a key value
